## About Project:<br />
Sorting is an attempt to visualize and help to understand how some of the most
famous sorting algorithms work. This project provides two standpoints to look at algorithms, one
is more artistic (apologies to any real artist out there), the other is more analytical aiming at
explaining algorithm step by step.<br />
This project does not want to teach the theory of sorting algorithms, there are amazing resources,
books and courses for this purpose. Sorting is for the ones who want to see these algorithms under
a different ligth and hopefully appreciate the processing and brain power behind these piece of
genius that in many ways have changed the way we live.

## Various Algorithms Used:<br />
Bubble Sort Algorithm.<br />
Selection Sort Algorithm.<br />
Insertion Sort Algorithm.<br />
Ripple Sort Algorithm.<br />
Quick Sort Algorithm.<br />
Merge Sort Algorithm.<br />


## Features:
1. Scaling the number of elements to be sorted.
2. Choosing algorithm within various sorting techniques.
3. Visualization of data in form of Bar Graphs.
4. Using randomize to input data to the algorithms.
5. Display with two windows:<br />
•	 Introduction window. <br />
•	Window with instructions, various techniques and Output view. 

## Requirements:
•	Operating System: Windows 7 or higher.<br />
•	Processor: Intel i3, i5, i7 or others.<br />
•	Graphics card (Not Mandatory).<br />
•	RAM: 2GB and higher.<br />
•	ROM: 500GB or Higher.<br />

# Conclusion :
Another way of looking at this project is as an analytical tool to study how sorting
algorithms work. Beside generating visuals representations, Sorting provides a walk-through that
guides the reader step after step along the process of ordering a lists of integer numbers.
All the steps are tracked: comparison operations happening behind the scene through the use of
animated indicators, changes of position of items.
